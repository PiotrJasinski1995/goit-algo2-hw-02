# Task 1. Optimising the 3D Printer Queue in the University Lab

Develop a program to optimise a 3D printing task queue, considering the priorities and technical limitations of the printer, using a greedy algorithm.

Task Description

1. Use input data in the form of a list of print jobs, where each job contains: ID, model volume, priority, and printing time.
2. Implement the main function optimize_printing, which should:
- Take into account the priorities of the tasks.
- Group models for simultaneous printing.
- Check volume and quantity constraints.
- Calculate the total printing time.
= Return the optimal printing order.
- Output the optimal printing order and the total time required to complete all tasks.


# Task 2. Optimal Rod Cutting for Maximum Profit (Rod Cutting Problem)

Develop a program to find the optimal way to cut a rod in order to achieve the maximum profit. You need to implement two approaches: using recursion with memoization and using tabulation.

Task Description

1. The input consists of the length of the rod and an array of prices, where price[i] is the price of a rod of length i+1.
2. You need to determine how to cut the rod in order to achieve the maximum profit.
3. Implement both dynamic programming approaches.
4. Output the optimal cutting strategy and the maximum profit.
